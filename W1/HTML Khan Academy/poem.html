    <h1>Shakespeare's sonnet I</h1>
    <p>From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br>
But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
